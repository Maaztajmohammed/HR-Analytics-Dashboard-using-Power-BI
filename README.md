# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-using-Power-BI

This project involves designing a Power BI dashboard to help the HR department analyze employee attrition rates and identify trends. Using historical data on employee attrition, the dashboard provides insights through dynamic, interactive visuals that break down attrition by key demographics and metrics: salary, age, job role, gender, and education level.
